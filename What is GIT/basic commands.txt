git init : initialise empty git rpeository on local

 touch names.txt

 git status - shows history of untracked files, staged files, commits

to create a snapshot of changes in your local:
stage->commit->push
git add .           OR  git add 'filename'           OR  git add 'dir  name'             OR git add 'dir  name' 'filename'

 -> git commit -m "blah"

  -> git push

....................
git log           --> to see history of all commits

git reset d4d9fe5e5d42d9845ca3ef21b970026a20ab58421~        
 --> removes all commits made after this commit/resets branch to that particular commit
 -->do not forget to remove '1~' from commit id

 .....................
 git stash
 put all your current changes + staged changes to backstage
should be-uncommited changes
....................
git stash pop 
to bring all stashed changes back
git stsh clear  
to remove all stashed changes [delete]

....................
git remote add origin <github-repo-name>
origin = name of repo

 git remote -v
 details of remote url and name

 git push origin master
 --in above we could use whole url instead of name reference origin
 ..................
 branches:
used for feature separation, bugfixes, uat, production code
never commit on main branch
Create branch - git branch abc
switch to branch - git checkout abc
......
basic touch commands:
vi filename.txt
keypress -> i
enter text etc
keypress -> ESC -> shift+: => type wq (save n Exit), q(save and continue)
....................
merging feature into master branches:
feature branch(with changes) -> a
master branch-> b

- git checkout b
- git merge a 

resolve conflicts within files

- git add .
- git commit -m "resolved conflicts"

(HEAD -> feature/hotelbranches, origin/feature/hotelbranches)
-indicates the current pointer of activity is pointing to the branch
- second paramter indicates remote(origin) branch to which all commits ae made 

............
Git fork:

ceate a copy of another project in your account

github -> goto user-> project -> fork
terminal -> git clone <URL>

upstream URL = from where we have forked the project
to connect forked repo to fork-from repo:

$ git remote add upstream <fork-from URL>
.............
push changes to branch of your copy of forked project:

git push origin learn/git-fork-learning 
this will create a mesg on upstream repo for merge and pull request

If a branch has pull request -> new changes wont create a new pull request
so when required you create new branch for each new feature/bug etc
.................
If you create a new branch and 
do 
-git push origin <- it will not push to new branch 
- git push origin <newbranch>
....................
removing a commit from PR(forked to original repo)

> git reset commitid       <- commitid above which the commits needed to be removed
> git add .
> git stash
> git push origin <featurebranch> -f       <- its a forced push to update the PR with removed commit already present in PR
.......................

git fetch --all -prune   => fetches all the ahead commits in other branches to the current branch (-prune for all deleted commits as well)

ALTERNATIVELY -> git pull upstream master

fork repo/ branch 123 --> 2 commits-->PR to origrepo(master) --> merged
/branch 123 = has 2 commits changes ✓
/origrepo(master) = has 2 commits changes ✓

but

/forkedrepo/master = has 2 commits changes ╳ No!

to bring forkedrepocopy-master branch uptodate with origrepo-master
1. git checkout master (forked repo copy)
2. git pull
3. git fetch --all --prune
4. git reset --hard upstream/master
5. git push origin master
`This branch is up to date with.........`

....
deleting a branch

$ git branch --delete learn/delete-commits
Deleted branch learn/delete-commits (was 83ae90d).
................................
combining multiple commits into one
1. git log -> displays -> <commit-1>, <commit-2>, <commit-3>

2. git rebase -i commit-1
--opens a text editor to enter combo commit message for commit-2 and commit-3 to combine into one
[editor: press i, enter commmit msg, press esc, press shift+:, press wq]

3. git log -> display -> <commit-1>, <combo-commit of commit-2 and commit-3>
..................................
git reset --hard 83ae90d63c3c648786ab55803c3a18ba002ce840
removes all ahead commits of the mentioned commit-id
.................................
merge conflict:
1. if we do git pull
2. merge conflicts come 
3. resolve in files 
4. git add .
5. git commit -m "commit has resolve merge changes"
6. git push origin master
7. create PR   -> merge
8. git pull upstream/master 
...............................
git interactive rebase
- work on commits present in local
-not for commits pushed to repo

............................
changing last commit message
git commit --amend "message updated"

another way:
1. git log -> HEAD->c1, c2 ,c3,c4 ,c5
2. git rebase HEAD~3
